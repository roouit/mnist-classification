# mnist-classification

In this project I'll classify the [MNIST-dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/) with various techniques.

I'll use Python and libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow and keras.

### TO DO
* Feed forward neural network with Tensorflow and Keras - **IN PROGRESS**
* Convolutional neural network with Tensorflow and Keras - *NOT STARTED*
* FFNN or CNN without ML libraries - *NOT STARTED*
* Other machine learning classification techniques (KNN, Decision tree, Random forest) - *NOT STARTED*
